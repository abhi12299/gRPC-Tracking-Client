## An example of grpc-web with React application

Server side code available [here](https://github.com/abhi12299/gRPC-Tracking-Server).

This example demonstrates how you can use grpc-web to track user activity on your website.

If you want to handle it on a web worker, switch to webworker branch by
` git checkout webworker`. For more details about that, check the readme there.
